# Stroke Prediciton Analysis

Effects of a stroke depend on several factors, including daily routine of a person, his or her environmental factor, stress level which depends upon professional and personal life, Eating habits and many other catalysts. Medical science says stroke is not only stress induced bodily behaviour but also can genetically propagate maong generations of people in their family. So, to determine how stroke can be predicted based on typical characteristics of human life, this prediction analysis has been completed using different predictive modelling(Random Classifier Model, Logistic Regression Model, Naive-Bayes, KNN- Classifier,etc.) to generate efficient outcome for future prupose.
